This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in different programming languages(mostly Java). The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive collection of code examples and resources for learning and practicing data structures and algorithms.

## Data Structures
The data structures section includes implementations of the following:

* Arrays
* Linked Lists
* Stacks
* Queues
* Trees
* Graphs
* Hash Tables
* Heaps

Each data structure is implemented in multiple programming languages, such as Java and Python.

## Algorithms
The algorithms section covers a wide range of topics, including:

* Sorting Algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort)
* Searching Algorithms (e.g., Linear Search, Binary Search)
* Graph Algorithms (e.g., Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm)
* Dynamic Programming
* Greedy Algorithms
* Divide and Conquer Algorithms
* Recursion

Like the data structures, the algorithms are implemented in various programming languages.
